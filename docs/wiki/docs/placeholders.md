# PlaceHolders

The following placeholders are available in MCTennis and can also be used via PlaceHolderApi.

!!! note "PlaceHolder Api"
    As MCTennis supports multiple games per server, you need to specify the name of the game in external plugins. You can do this by appending the name of the game ``_game1`` ``_mygame``.
    This results into placeholders such as e.g. ``%mctennis_game_isEnabled_game1%`` or ``%mctennis_game_displayName_mygame%``. This is only relevant in external plugins. For placeholders in MCTennis, you can directly use the placeholders below.
