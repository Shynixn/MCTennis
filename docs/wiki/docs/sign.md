# Signs

This page explains how to create signs for joining and leave.

### Create a join sign

* Place a new sign in your world
* Execute the following command:

```
/mctennis sign game1 join
```

* Rightclick on a sign
* This sign simply executes the ``/mctennis join`` command on behalf of the player. You can create team join signs by searching for the created sign in your ``game1.yml`` and editing the command to e.g. ``/mctennis join red``

### Create a leave sign

* Place a new sign in your world
* Execute the following command:

```
/mctennis sign game1 leave
```

* Rightclick on a sign
* This sign simply executes the ``/mctennis leave`` command on behalf of the player. 

### Removing a sign

* Simply destroy the sign with your hand
